         The Philani Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Trust has been addressing maternal, 
         child health and nutrition problems in the informal settlements surrounding Cape Town since 1979. 
         Philani's mandate is sustainable community health, and, over the years, we have developed programmes to meet the needs of the communities we serve. 
         As an organisation we aim to improve health outcomes by combining our skills and resources with the knowledge and resources that exist in the community.
